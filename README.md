# ROS 2 Lidar-Based Emergency Stop System

This system uses a **LiDAR sensor** to detect obstacles, calculates the minimum distance in front, issues a warning if the object is too close, and triggers an **emergency stop**.

## Overview

The system is composed of **three ROS 2 nodes**:
1. `LidarProcessor`: Subscribes to LiDAR data (`/scan`), publishes the front distance to `/min_distance`.
2. `ProximityWarning`: Subscribes to `/min_distance`, checks if the robot is too close to an obstacle and publishes a warning to `/proximity_warning`.
3. `EmergencyStop`: Subscribes to `/proximity_warning`, and if a stop signal is received, publishes zero velocity to `/cmd_vel`.

## Node 1: `LidarProcessor`

### Function:
- Subscribes to sensor_msgs/msg/LaserScan on topic /scan
- Publishes std_msgs/msg/Float32 to topic /min_distance

## Node 2: ProximityWarning
### Function:
- Subscribes to std_msgs/msg/Float32 on topic /min_distance
- Publishes std_msgs/msg/String to topic /proximity_warning if distance â‰¤ 1 meter

## Node 3: EmergencyStop
### Function:
- Subscribes to std_msgs/msg/String on topic /proximity_warning
- Publishes geometry_msgs/msg/Twist to topic /cmd_vel to stop the robot
